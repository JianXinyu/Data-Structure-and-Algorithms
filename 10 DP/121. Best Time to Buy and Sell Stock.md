# Question
[link](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.
Choose a single day to buy stock and choose another day to sell stock.
Return the maximum profit. If no profit, return 0.

Constraints:
-   `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
-   `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`
# Analysis
typical DP.
状态定义：dp[i] := 直到这天能得到的最大利润. max profit up to i-th day
边界条件：dp[0] = 0
状态转移：dp[i] = prices[i] - minimum so far. or 0.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        const int n = prices.size();
        int dp = 0;
        int m = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            dp = max(dp, prices[i] - m);
            m = min(prices[i], m);
        }
        return dp;
    }
};
```
