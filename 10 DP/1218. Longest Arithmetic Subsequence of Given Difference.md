# Question
[link](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/)
Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`.
Return the length of the longest **subsequence** in `arr` which is an arithmetic subsequence s.t. the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

> A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2 -> output = 4 [7,5,3,1]

Constraints:
-   $1 <= arr.length <= 10^5$
-   $-10^4 <= arr[i], difference <= 10^4$
# Analysis
这题很妙，dp思想的使用与其他题目不同。需要使用hashtable，且**把元素作为key**，以该元素为结尾的subsequence的长度作为value。

- 状态定义  $dp[x] := $以x元素结尾的subsequence的长度
- 边界条件 无
- 状态转移方程 $dp[x] = dp[x-diff] + 1$

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int diff) {
        int ans = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> dp;
        for(int x : arr)
        {
            ans = max(ans, dp[x] = dp[x-diff] + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

- Time complexity: $O(n)$
- Space complexity: $O(n)$ the worst case happens when every element is different and can't form a subsequence, now the size of hashtable is $2n$, since $dp[x-diff]$ isn't in the hashtable and needs to be created.
