# Question
[link](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/delete-and-earn/)
You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:
- Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.

Constraints:
-   `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
-   `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`

# Analysis
Reduce the problem to [[198. House Robber]]

Key observations: If we take nums[i]

1. We can safely take all of its copies.
2. We can’t take any of copies of nums[i – 1] and nums[i + 1]

建立一个数组，以nums[i]作为下标，nums[i]的个数作为值，这样就可以转换为[[198. House Robber]]

- 先求出旧数组的范围，根据范围确定新数组的长度
- 迭代旧数组，给新数组赋值

[3 4 2] -> [0 1 1 1], rob([0 **2** 3 **4**]) = 6       

[2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4] -> [0 2 3 1], rob([0 2*2 **3\*3** 4]) = 9

```cpp
int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
	if (nums.empty()) return 0;
	const int n = nums.size();
	
	int dp1 = 0, dp2 = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
	{
		int dp = max(dp2 + nums[i], dp1);
		dp2 = dp1;
		dp1 = dp;
	}
	return dp1;
}

int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums)
{
    if(nums.empty()) return 0;
    const auto range = minmax_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    const int l = *(range.first);
    const int r = *(range.second);
    vector<int> points(r - l + 1, 0);
    for(const int num : nums)
        points[num - l] += num;

    return rob(points);
}

```
Time complexity: O(n+r) reduction + O(r) solving rob = O(n + r)

Space complexity: O(r)

r = max(nums) – min(nums) + 1
